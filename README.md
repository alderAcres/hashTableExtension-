#CS-Fundamentals-Assessment

##Summary
Week 1 assessment will be used to assess your understanding of the material provided in the past week. We'll be building an implementation of a hash table. At the end of the period, commit your work and submit a pull request. This is done solo. **DO NOT** look at previous code or ask your cohort-mates for help. However, your other resources (e.g. google, stack overflow) are allowed.

##How do I get started?
1. Complete the challenge in located in src/HashTable.js.

1. Make sure the hash table has the following properties:

  - can get, set, and remove properties and their values
  - can handle collisions
  - doubles in size when 75% of the space is filled
  - halves in size when 25% of the space is filled

##How do I know if my answer is correct?
There are no tests for this assessment. **The onus is on you to determine if our answer is correct.** You can test the behavior of your data structure in the chrome console, in node in the terminal, or any other JavaScript interpreter. 

##What do I do when I am done?
1. When completed - commit and push your changes to your GitHub

2. Submit a pull request to the CodesmithLLC organization
